   * broadcasts page-side and wait for the next one, still capped at
   * `SYNC_WAIT_MS` so a sync that never signals (circuit breaker open, no
   * vault, intercom port re-created) costs no more than it did before.
   *
   * Caveat: the transaction processor broadcasts the same bare `SYNC_COMPLETED`
   * per loop pass (`transaction-processor.ts`), so while the tx queue is
   * draining this can be satisfied by a processor tick rather than by the sync.
   * That window is exactly when pending-note counts are non-zero anyway, and

   *      click" round can miss newly-landed notes. Looping over sync →

   * in flight when the run ended) are exactly the difference between that
   * assumption and reality, which is what lets a caller reconcile the two
   * instead of reporting a phantom loss.
   *
   * `failed` is terminal with no RECORDED submit crossing — which is weaker
   * than proof of none, since the stamp is best-effort and its write is
   * deliberately swallowed on failure; `pending` covers
   * Queued/Generating (0/1), which for a requeued row means "will retry, hasn't
   * moved value yet". Amounts are converted to the same display units
   * `quickBalanceSnapshot` reports, so the two are directly comparable.
   *
   * `failedMaybeSubmitted` is held apart and deliberately NOT offered as
   * unlanded value. The wallet stamps `mayHaveSubmitted` at the submit crossing
   * precisely because a row can end Failed with its transaction already on
   * chain; counting that as "never landed" would accuse the wallet of losing
   * value on a run where value moved exactly as intended. It is reported both so
   * the caller can surface it — a Failed-but-possibly-landed send is worth
   * knowing about — and as the explicit bound on the ambiguity: the per-wallet
   * reconciliation allows a discrepancy only up to this value, and only in the
   * direction the ambiguous rows could have moved value.
   *
   * `storeMissing` distinguishes "this wallet has no send rows" from "this read
   * did not find the database". `indexedDB.open` with no version CREATES an
   * empty database rather than failing, so a read against the wrong origin
   * succeeds and returns a flawless all-zero result. Without the flag, that is
   * indistinguishable from a perfect run.
