 * → Permissions and data. That is a second consent sitting beside "Share usage
 * data", and two consents that can disagree is a defect, so both have to say
 * yes before anything is sent.
 *
 * **How "this browser has no such concept" is told apart from "this browser
 * said no".** This is the whole difficulty, and getting it backwards fails
 * silently in one of two directions: read an absent mechanism as a refusal and
 * telemetry dies everywhere including Chrome and mobile, with no error; read a
 * refusal as an absent mechanism and we collect from someone who explicitly
 * declined. Neither shows up as a crash.
 *
 * The discriminator is therefore NOT whether the call throws — Chrome would
 * reject an unknown `data_collection` key passed to `permissions.contains()`,
 * so keying off a throw is exactly the trap. It is the **presence of the
 * `data_collection` key in the `permissions.getAll()` response**, which is the
 * mechanism Mozilla documents for feature-detecting this experience at runtime:
 *
 * - **Key absent** — the browser does not implement data-collection consent at
 *   all (Chrome, any Firefox below 140). There is no browser-level answer to
 *   honour, so this gate abstains and the wallet's own setting decides.
 * - **Key present** — the browser implements it and its answer is
 *   authoritative. Granted only if the array actually names our data type. An
 *   empty array is a refusal, not an absence, and that is the distinction the
 *   key's presence buys us.
 *
 * Everything else fails **closed**: a non-extension context aside, a throw, a
 * rejected promise, or a `data_collection` that is not an array all return
 * false, because an error reading a permission must never read as permission
 * granted.
 *
 * Off-extension (mobile, desktop) there is no extension permission model to
 * consult, so this abstains rather than failing closed. Abstaining is not
 * failing open: the caller still requires the wallet's own setting to be on.
