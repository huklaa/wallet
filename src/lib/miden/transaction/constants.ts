/**
 * The request reached the kernel without the fee conversion info `fee::pay_fee`
 * needs, so the fee could not be charged at all.
 *
 * NOT a balance problem, and the distinction matters: this says nothing about
 * what the account holds, so telling the user to "receive some MIDEN" sends them
 * to top up an account that is very likely already funded, and topping it up
 * changes nothing. A genuine shortfall arrives as a vault assertion and gets
 * `TRANSACTION_VAULT_SHORTFALL_ERROR` instead.
 *
 * What it actually means is that whoever BUILT the request did not commit
 * conversion info into its auth args. On a multisig account the client cannot
 * inject that -- the auth-arg slot belongs to the multisig -- so the request has
 * to carry it, and a request built elsewhere may not.
 *
 * The flows that produce request bytes before any proposal is created -- Epoch
 * bridged-send and earn-deposit (`buildEpochCollateralRequestBytes`), AggLayer
 * bridged-send (`initiateB2AggBridge`) and the swap's PSWAP note
 * (`buildPswapCreateRequest`) -- declare a fee conversion SALT at BUILD time, each
 * taking it as a `feeSalt` argument. miden-client derives the native 1/1 conversion
 * info from the execution reference header and commits it into the auth arg itself.
 *
 * It has to be the build, not the finished request: the SDK exposes only a getter
 * for the auth arg on `TransactionRequest`, deliberately, because miden-client keeps
 * it mutually exclusive with the fee conversion salt and enforces that on the builder.
 * A finished request also cannot be rebuilt into one -- its readers cover neither
 * input notes nor the script, and `serialize()` is not canonical, so a rebuild could
 * neither carry everything forward nor prove that it did.
 *
 * A dApp `execute` is the one flow whose bytes the wallet does not build, so it
 * commits nothing and cannot pay a fee on a fee-charging chain.
 *
 * So this message means no conversion info reached the kernel. That happens when the
 * request declared no salt, or when the account's auth component is one miden-client
 * cannot classify and so declines to commit for -- a guarded multisig deployed before
 * guardian 0.17.0-rc.3 is exactly that case. Not an exhaustive
 * list, and the module is the place to read for the current one.
 *
 * What they share is that a retry can plausibly help, so the copy does NOT forbid
 * one -- an earlier version did, from when no retry could have.
