 * are refused because the row is now terminal: the `setStage('submitting')` the
 * retry guard reads, and the completion write that captures the transaction id.
 * The row is left frozen at whichever pre-submit stage the cancel caught it in,
 * and Retry reads exactly that as proof nothing was broadcast — then rebuilds
 * the request with a fresh note serial and pays the recipient twice.
 *
 * The GUARDIAN leaves stamp `mayHaveSubmitted` before submitting, through the
 * terminal row, so a crossing that happens there IS recorded — but only from the
 * moment the leaf reaches it: a cancel during execute or prove lands earlier, and
 * Retry is one tap away on the same screen. `cancelledInFlightAt` covers that
 * window and then expires — see its docstring for why a sticky flag here was
 * wrong.
 *
 * Read that scope literally. A send from a NON-guardian account stamps nothing at
 * all: its leaf calls straight through to the proxy, and the row it leaves behind
 * is frozen at the 'sending' its pipeline stamped once at pickup. For those rows
 * this marker is not a supplement to a recorded crossing, it is the only signal
 * there is, which is why `requeueFailedTransaction` refuses on it rather than
 * merely holding bytes, and why the residual gap documented there is the shape it
 * is.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT used by the pipeline's own catch handlers, which instead
 * CLEAR the marker: by the time those run the pipeline has stopped. That
 * asymmetry is what still lets a genuine execute or prove failure rebuild its
 * request — the rebuild this guard exists to gate, not to prevent.

 * nothing about which side of the submit it landed on, and the result that would
 * have carried the transaction id died with the realm. For a `send` that is the

 * nor an id to ask the node about, so it is recorded as a real crossing —
 * permanently, because the ambiguity never resolves — and `requeueFailedTransaction`

 *                         Completed / 'Received' (funds-visibility safe).
 *   - `'landed-external'` the note is `ConsumedExternal` — its nullifier is on
 *                         chain but the consuming tx was NOT submitted by this
 *                         client, so it is consumed by *someone* yet NOT provably
 *                         mine (a reclaimable P2IDE could have been reclaimed by
 *                         its sender). Ambiguous for funds-visibility.
 *   - `'invalid'`         the note is `Invalid` (e.g. nullifier reused / never
 *                         committed) — the consume can never land; fail fast.
 *   - `'processing'`      the note is `ProcessingAuthenticated` /
 *                         `ProcessingUnauthenticated` — a consuming transaction of
 *                         OURS was submitted and applied locally, and its block is
 *                         not committed yet. In flight, not failed: within a few
 *                         blocks it becomes a consumed state or reverts to
 *                         `Committed`, so the caller must leave the row alone and
 *                         re-ask, never terminal-fail it.
 *   - `'not-landed'`      the note still exists and is not consumed or in flight
 *                         (Committed / Expected / Unverified) — the consume did
 *                         NOT land.
 *   - `'unknown'`         no note row for the id, or the node query errored —
 *                         indeterminate (never treated as landed).

/**
 * Node-authoritative check of whether a consume's input note landed on chain.
 *
 * A consume's input `noteId` is known BEFORE the write executes (it is stamped on
 * the tx row), and the note's on-chain consumed-state is the source of truth for
 * whether the consume actually landed — so this stays authoritative even when a
 * local `TransactionResult` was lost (e.g. an offscreen write deadline-killed with
 * `OperationAbortedError`, issue #260 follow-up #3a).
 *
 * When `sync` is true, best-effort syncs first so the note state reflects the
 * latest chain head (a sync failure falls back to the last-synced state, which is
 * still authoritative for a consumed note — a consumed note never reverts). The
 * immediate killed-consume path passes `true` because it resolves ONE tx and wants
 * the freshest state before deciding; the background reaper passes `false` because
 * it runs alongside AutoSync and must NOT fire one sync per stuck consume (that
 * would be N syncs/cycle where the pre-#3a reaper did 0).
 *
 * Maps the node-backed note state to a {@link ConsumeLandedVerdict}. FUNDS-SAFETY:
 * only a LOCAL consumed state (provably this client's own tracked consume) yields
 * `'landed-local'`, the sole verdict a caller may treat as "my consume landed" and
 * surface as Completed / 'Received'. `ConsumedExternal` is reported separately as
 * `'landed-external'` (consumed, but not provably mine) so the caller decides; no
 * caller marks it Received — neither the killed-consume path nor the stuck-consume
 * reaper. A missing note or a thrown error yields `'unknown'`; an error or any
 * uncertainty NEVER yields `'landed-local'`, so a false Received is impossible.

/**
 * Verify stuck transactions by checking note state from the node.

 * - If the note has been consumed on-chain, mark the transaction as completed
 * - If the note is invalid, mark as failed immediately
 * - If the note is still claimable AND the tx has been processing for > 1 minute, mark as failed
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Only checks GeneratingTransaction status, NOT Queued.
 * Queued transactions haven't started processing yet, so the note being claimable is expected.
 *
 * Delegates the per-tx node check to {@link verifyConsumeLanded} (the same
 * authority the killed-consume requeue uses, issue #260 follow-up #3a). Passes
 * `sync: false`: this reaper runs alongside AutoSync (which keeps note state
 * fresh), so it must NOT fire one sync per stuck consume — matching its pre-#3a
 * behavior of 0 syncs/cycle.
 *   - `'landed-local'` → mark Completed. FUNDS-SAFETY: this is the ONLY verdict that
 *                      may become a 'Received' row, exactly as on the killed-consume
 *                      path (see tryCompleteKilledConsume). This reaper is the sole

 *                      returns early on `isExtension()` and `tryCompleteKilledConsume`
 *                      fires only on the Chrome-offscreen `OperationAbortedError` — so
 *                      a lenient rule here would be the ONLY rule those platforms run.
 *   - `'landed-external'` → the note is consumed on chain but NOT provably by us (a
 *                      recallable P2IDE the sender recalled, or another consumer of
 *                      the same public note, lands in that state). Treated exactly
 *                      like `'not-landed'`: failed after the processing grace window,
 *                      never Completed. The residual is a SAFE false-Failed — a
 *                      re-consume harmlessly collides on the spent nullifier and the
 *                      next sync reconciles — instead of a false 'Received' telling
 *                      the user they got funds a third party actually took.
 *   - `'invalid'`    → fail IMMEDIATELY with INVALID_NOTE_ERROR: an Invalid note can
 *                      never be consumed, so there is no reason to wait out the grace
 *                      window and surface the generic interrupted error instead.
 *   - `'processing'` → a consuming tx of ours is submitted and applied locally but
 *                      not committed yet → skip (leave for a later cycle). Failing
 *                      it would terminal-fail a claim that already reached the
 *                      node — and on a Guardian account that is the COMMON path,
 *                      because `runGuardianPipeline` releases the WASM lock after
 *                      `submit()`/`apply()` and only then runs a multi-second
 *                      `service.sync()`, leaving the row `GeneratingTransaction`
 *                      and this reaper free to read the note mid-window.
 *   - `'not-landed'` → the note exists but is not consumed; fail only after the
 *                      processing grace window so an actively-processing consume
 *                      isn't reaped mid-flight.
 *   - `'unknown'`    → no note / query error → skip (leave for a later cycle).
